# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

Credit card fraud is a major issue that can result in significant financial losses for individuals and financial institutions. Machine learning techniques have been used to detect credit card fraud, but the imbalance of fraud transactions makes it challenging to develop accurate models.

In this proposal, we are comparing two popular techniques:
- **Hard Neural Network-based Undersampling**
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**

These techniques will be applied on an imbalanced credit card fraud dataset. We will apply both techniques to the training set and train a Random Forest algorithm classifier. The performance of the classifiers will be evaluated by comparing each technique to the baseline performance of the system without any techniques for addressing class imbalance.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that Hard Neural Network-based Undersampling will result in a more interpretable model compared to SMOTE because it directly removes instances from the training set rather than generating synthetic instances.

## Significance
The findings in this study will be useful for financial institutions and researchers interested in developing accurate fraud detection models for credit card transactions.
